# Machine-Learning-with-Q-Learning


Please note, this project utilizes two Python files as imports in the Jupyter notebook file. The focus of this project is on reinforcement learning with RL procedures and a Q-Learning algorithm, which was implemented by the author. The environment consists of a grid with a starting point (the agent) on the top-left and a treasure on the bottom-right. Randomly placed obstacles represent the shaded cells that the agent must navigate around to reach the treasure. As the agent undergoes iterations of this game, episodic memory is stored to facilitate exploration and exploitation, and tuples of states and actions are aggregated with reward values. Over time and with enough epochs, the agent learns to optimally navigate the locations of obstacles to reach the treasure. The final iteration of the game shows the optimal path taken by the agent from the initial spot to the treasure.

The concept of reinforcement learning has real-world implications in the field of machine learning. The ability of an agent to learn from past experiences and use reward values to determine optimal intermediate actions is fundamental to the psychological phenomenon of reinforcement learning. However, there are ethical concerns surrounding the use of RL policies in machine learning architectures, as algorithmic bias can result in racial, sexual, and ethnocentric biases being embedded in the architectural procedures.
